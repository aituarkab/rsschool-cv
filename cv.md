## About Me 
My name is Kabdulin Aytuar and for the last 3 years I have been working as the head of project managers in a company far from IT. Today I am a project manager in an IT company supporting a national oil and gas company in Kazakhstan. I support projects with such technologies as: ะก#, .NET, PHP, Laravel. 

At the end of last year, I decided to become a developer, today I am taking *C# / .NET* courses at **Udemy** and *Javascript* courses at **The Rolling Scopes School**.
